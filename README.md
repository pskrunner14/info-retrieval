# Boolean Query Model for IR
[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/5f50df4426554ef9802ae7c69c430f52)](https://www.codacy.com/app/pskrunner14/info-retrieval?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=pskrunner14/info-retrieval&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

This is a Boolean Query Model for Information Retrieval in Python. Information retrieval is the activity of obtaining information system resources relevant to an information need from a collection of information resources. Searches can be based on full-text or other content-based indexing. We only implement text based indexing in this project. We use a Boolean Query Model to retrieve relevant information from our documents. The Boolean model of information retrieval is a classical information retrieval model and, at the same time, the first and most-adopted one. It is used by many IR systems to this day.

### Getting Started

To be able to run the search script, you'll need a few dependencies first:
```
pip install nltk
```

You also need to download and install [Python Algorithms Library](https://github.com/laurentluce/python-algorithms) from sources using:
```
cd python-algorithms/
python setup.py install
```

Once all that is done, change the `docs` and `stop_words` lists in `search.py` and get searching:

```
python search.py
```

### Results

```
~$ python search.py

INVERTED INDEX:

hello: [1, 2]
i: [1]
m: [1]
machin: [1, 4]
learn: [1, 4]
engin: [1, 2, 4]
bad: [2, 3]
world: [2, 3]
peopl: [2]
place: [3]
great: [4]
that: [4]

Enter boolean query: machine AND engineer
